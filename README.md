# Happy Thoughts

This is a project where I have fetch an API about Happy thougths and build a app similare to Twitter. It will showcase the last 20 happy thougths that have been send in, you will be able to send a thought by yourself and like those that warms your heart. 

## The problem

I started to plan how many components I needed to build this app and also which div/section I needed if i could re-use the names so it will be easier to style in CSS. After I finished the planning I started to creat Formcontainer which is my wrapper for the full App. Then i went step by step in the compononts. 

I struggle a lot whit the Eslint extension and How the API was written but when i figured it out it worked fine. 

Resourse I've been using is: 
- Technigo exampel project. 
- google. 
- Stack overflow.
